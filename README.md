This is essentially the "design doc".
Going in, I am thinking something in-between a shmup and an infinite runner.
I have a dude on the screen, moving around, appropriately zoomed-in.
I have a sword appearing as well. 

Because the theme is "only one":

- Only one source file. Hardcore, but the build speed is so fast!
- Only one sword. As you kill things and collect powerups, your sword will grow in power.
- Only one life. I want to be rather brutal/punishing if you mess-up.
- Only one hitpoint. If you get hit, it is gameover.
  - However, this will encourage "highscore"-style competition.
  - Who can get the furthest?
  - Who can kill the most?
  - Who can level-up their sword the furthest?

- Orcs spawning with velocity. 
- Need collision soon.
- Need off-screen removal.
- Need kill count.
- Need parallax scrolling.
